# Synthesis

**Automate. Survive. Cure.**

In a world overrun by the infected, humanity's last hope lies in the power of industry. **Synthesis** is a voxel-based survival game that blends high-stakes combat with complex factory automation. You aren't just fighting to live another day; you are engineering the salvation of the human race.

## The Mission

The infection spreads fast, but your machines run faster. Your goal is simple but daunting: synthesize the cure. To do this, you must harvest resources, build supply chains, and research lost technologies while holding back the relentless undead.

## Key Mechanics

### 🏭 Build & Automate
From manual mining to fully automated mega-factories. Design intricate conveyor belt systems, manage power grids, and optimize production lines to craft everything from basic bullets to advanced biochemical compounds.

### 🧟 Defend the Machine
Your noise attracts them. As your factory grows, so does the threat. Construct walls, turrets, and traps to protect your critical infrastructure from massive hordes of zombies. If the factory stops, humanity falls.

### 🧪 Research & Discovery
Explore a vast, procedurally generated voxel world. Venture into dangerous territories to find rare isotopes and ancient data essential for synthesizing the final cure.

### ⚔️ Friends or Foes
Play solo or join a server. Collaborate with others to build industrial wonders and shared defenses, or compete for scarce resources in a hostile world where other players can be just as dangerous as the infected.
